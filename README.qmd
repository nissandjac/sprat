## Introduction

This repository serves to compare different potential model configurations for the North Sea sprat. All the models we will show are based on the seasonal $smsR$ model. Until 2025 the model has run with ADMB, but here we use the smsR package available at

$smsR$ is an R package which can be used to set up seasonal assessment through few R functions. Each of the functions offer simple to complex model setups, which can both respect historical assessment methods and more modern implementation of e.g., random effects. The package is currently used as assessments for the four North Sea Sandeel stocks, and a thorough comparison of the TMB and ADMB performance can be seen in the WKSANDEEL report.  

We have chosen model setups that are close to the previous ones, but all the models we will provide here has a transparent data flow, and try to follow best statistical practices. Over the history of the stock many small modifications have been applied to the model setup and input data to a point where some of the changes are not traceable anymore. By resetting all these changes we provide options for a model with annual, half-year, and quarterly time steps. 

## Current model and issues 
The current sprat model originated in the 2018(?) sprat benchmark. In the past years the model has han convergence issues, particularly with the maximum gradient being above an acceptable level. The issue has been solved by taking the 0-group from the Q1 survey. 
Another issue has been XYZ, which has been solved by moving the catches into seasons where they did not originate. 
Additionally, several of the models parameters are estimated on the boundaries, leading to slow model convergence in TMB. ADMB has a particular feature that 'nudges' parameters away from boundary conditions leading to the perception that a parameter has been correctly estimated, when in reality it is stuck in an infinitely small difference between the estimated parameter and the set boundary.
