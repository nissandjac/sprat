## Introduction

This repository serves to compare different potential model configurations for the North Sea sprat. All the models we will show are based on the seasonal $smsR$ model. Until 2025 the model has run with ADMB, but here we use the smsR package available at

$smsR$ is an R package which can be used to set up seasonal assessment through few R functions. Each of the functions offer simple to complex model setups, which can both respect historical assessment methods and more modern implementation of e.g., random effects. The package is currently used as assessments for the four North Sea Sandeel stocks, and a thorough comparison of the TMB and ADMB performance can be seen in the WKSANDEEL report.
$smsR$ provides close to identical parameter estimations as the legacy ADMB SMS code, however there might be some minute differences, in particular due to how parameters close to the boundary is treated in ADMB and TMB. Below is a figure showing the similarity of derived stock quantities from the assessment performed in 2025
