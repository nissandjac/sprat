## Introduction

This repository serves to compare different potential model configurations for the North Sea sprat. All the models we will show are based on the seasonal $smsR$ model. Until 2025 the model has run with ADMB, but here we use the smsR package available at

*smsR* is an R package which can be used to set up seasonal assessment through few R functions. Each of the functions offer simple to complex model setups, which can both respect historical assessment methods and more modern implementation of e.g., random effects. The package is currently used as assessments for the four North Sea Sandeel stocks, and a thorough comparison of the TMB and ADMB performance can be seen in the WKSANDEEL report.

## Description of models 

All the models we have compared are in 'working_document_assessment.html'.
